# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management and program process documents. Its purpose is to centralize our lightweight, evidence-driven approach to delivering product and engineering work, give team members a single source of truth for project artifacts, and make processes easy to discover and update.

OctoAcme runs projects through a simple lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective. Initiation captures the problem, stakeholders, measurable success criteria, and a go/no‑go decision. Planning breaks approved initiatives into shippable work with a prioritized backlog, estimates, and a release plan. Execution uses visible workflows (project board columns, small pull requests, CI gates, and QA), and Release standardizes checks, smoke tests, and rollback playbooks. Retrospectives capture learning, convert them to tracked action items, and feed improvements back into the backlog.

Key workflows and roles are documented here. Product Managers (PdM) set outcomes and success metrics; Project Managers (PM) coordinate delivery, risks, and stakeholder communication; Developers build and test; Tech Leads/Architects provide technical direction; QA Leads validate acceptance criteria; DevOps Engineers manage deployment pipelines; UX/UI Designers ensure usability; Security Champions advocate for security best practices; Business Stakeholders provide strategic direction. See [Roles and Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for complete role descriptions.

Daily standups, a weekly delivery sync, regular demos, and documented escalation paths keep communication timely. Quality practices include unit/integration tests, CI security scans, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, and comprehensive release checklists with rollback procedures.

How to use and contribute:
- Read the detailed docs in this folder for each stage and process document.
- To propose changes, use the process update issue template: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml
- Keep the Project One-pager and live artifacts in the project repo so Copilot Spaces and team members can reference them as the single source of truth.
